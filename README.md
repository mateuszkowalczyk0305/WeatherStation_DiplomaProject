## Abstract:

The thesis titled "Weather Station with Air Quality Monitoring System" describes the process of designing and implementing a device for measuring outdoor atmospheric conditions. The work includes the theoretical foundations of the topics utilized during the implementation, an analysis of the encountered problems, and the conclusions drawn. The designed weather station enables measurements of air quality, including particulate matter concentrations, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, UV radiation (in the UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C ranges), and wind direction. Additionally, the project includes the design of a housing adapted for production using 3D printing technology.
